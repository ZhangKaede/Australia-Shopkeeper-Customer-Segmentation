# 1. Problem Statement

The data set cover online and offline transaction records and customers information. With the massive information, the stakeholders want to have a customer portrait and find out the value of each customer segment.  A clear understanding of their portrait and value may boost business operations and make their business more profitable.
# 2. Business Objectives
Based on the available dataset, we found that we can use RFM analytics for development of both e-commerce filed sales to find out the habits of each customer segment. The customer segmentation that will be generated by this project will later be able to help the olist to implement advertising / marketing strategies for each segment. The main goal of this project is to help meet the expectations of the company and create the grouping of each user segment through the following objectives:

*   Categorize customers based on their behavior, creating distinct segments through RFM Analytics.
*   Identify key defining characteristics within each customer segment.

By accomplishing these objectives, the Olist business team can effectively formulate marketing and advertising strategies tailored to the specific types or characteristics of each cluster we have established.
